## Work in progress

### Born Too Soon? Policy-Induced Birth Timing and Child Development  
**Authors:** Parijat Maitra, [Libertad González](https://libertadgonzalez.com/)  
**Status:** [Working Paper](https://bse.eu/research/working-papers/born-too-soon-the-educational-costs-of-early-elective-deliveries) (circulated as "Born Too Soon? The Educational Costs of Early Elective Deliveries")

**Abstract**  
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We examine the impact of policy-induced changes in birth timing on children’s health and educational outcomes. We exploit a natural experiment in Spain: the abrupt
termination of a generous child benefit at the end of 2010, which led to a sharp increase in elective deliveries during the final week of December. Children born during this spike had shorter gestation periods and lower birth-weight (within the normal range), and experienced a higher incidence of respiratory disorders during infancy. We find that the affected cohort of children had significantly lower school performance at age seven, suggesting large persistent effects on cognitive development.
